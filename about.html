<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 18 years old currently living in the US that likes to play videogames and soccer, have fun
  with friends and to workout sometimes. I'm studying in the Benjamin Franklin Cummings tech
  as an software and web developer in my first year of this carreer and I hope to get a certificate
  and work at some big tech company someday
